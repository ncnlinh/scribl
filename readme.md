## Idea evolution on Scribl:

1. At first we visioned it as app which allows users to post drawing or video to somebody's wall
2. After evaluation and refinement, we decided to keep to canvas joining and sharing, 
with the special feature to continue drawing on others' work
3. Then we came up with the idea to post not only static image but also process-recording gif
